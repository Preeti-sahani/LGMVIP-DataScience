Type: Beginner Level Task

Task 01: Iris Flower Classification ML Project

The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities. In this project I have use SVC model and checked the accuracy of model using Iris flower classification.

Task 02: Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

Stock values is very valuable but extremely hard to predict correctly for any human being on their own. This task seeks to solve the problem of Stock Prices Prediction by stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to predict future stock values.
